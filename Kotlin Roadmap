Kotlin Roadmap
1. Introduction to Kotlin
Overview: Understand Kotlin's advantages, compatibility with Java, and applications in Android development.
Setup: Install Kotlin in IntelliJ IDEA/Android Studio.
Basic Syntax: Learn about syntax structure, functions, and variables.
Key Topics:
Variables (mutable & immutable)
Data types
Basic functions and lambda expressions
2. Kotlin Fundamentals
Data Types & Variables: Explore var, val, and const keywords, null safety, and type inference.
Control Flow: Master conditional statements (if, when) and loops (for, while).
Key Topics:
Smart casts
Safe calls and nullability (?, !!, Elvis operator ?:)
3. Object-Oriented Programming in Kotlin
Classes and Objects: Understand classes, objects, and the object keyword for singleton pattern.
Inheritance & Polymorphism: Learn about open classes, method overriding, and abstract classes.
Interfaces & Delegation: Work with interfaces and the Kotlin-specific delegation pattern.
Key Topics:
Constructors (primary, secondary)
Data classes, sealed classes, and enums
4. Functional Programming Concepts
Higher-Order Functions: Understand functions as first-class citizens and use them as parameters or return types.
Lambda Expressions: Practice concise function expressions using lambdas.
Key Topics:
Inline functions
Extension functions
Scoping functions (let, apply, run, also, with)
5. Collections and Data Handling
Collections: Work with Kotlin's List, Set, and Map.
Collection Functions: Use common functions (filter, map, reduce, flatMap).
Key Topics:
Immutable vs mutable collections
Sequences for lazy evaluation
6. Coroutines and Concurrency
Introduction to Coroutines: Understand concurrency and the need for coroutines in Kotlin.
Coroutine Builders: Learn launch, async, withContext.
Key Topics:
Coroutine scopes (GlobalScope, ViewModelScope)
Structured concurrency
Suspending functions
7. Android Development with Kotlin
Kotlin for Android: Integrate Kotlin with Android Studio and explore Android fundamentals.
Android Components: Understand activities, fragments, ViewModel, LiveData, and Room Database.
Key Topics:
Jetpack Compose for UI
Dependency Injection (Dagger/Hilt)
Networking (Retrofit, Ktor)
8. Advanced Kotlin Topics
DSL (Domain-Specific Language): Build custom DSLs for cleaner, domain-specific code.
Kotlin Multiplatform: Develop applications that share code across Android, iOS, and other platforms.
Key Topics:
Annotation processing with Kotlin
Reflection
Testing (JUnit, MockK, Coroutine Test)
Essential Points Summary
Null Safety: Kotlinâ€™s null safety features are critical for robust applications.
Scoping Functions: let, apply, run, etc., enhance readability and reduce boilerplate.
Coroutines: Mastering coroutines is essential for efficient concurrency.
Extension Functions: Boost functionality without altering class definitions.
Jetpack Compose: Learn Compose for declarative UI in Android.
Kotlin Multiplatform: Shared code across platforms is a game-changer for cross-platform projects.
